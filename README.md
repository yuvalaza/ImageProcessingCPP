# ImageProcessingCPP
# Introduction
Welcome to my CPP project, which focuses on implementing various image processing algorithms from scratch such as filtering, edge detection, corner detection, SIFT detector, relevant mathematical functions and more. In addition I implemented my own matrix class that include many arithmetic and mathematical functions as well as suitable operators.
